# Predicting-a-Pulsar-Star
This project uses the random forest model to predict whether a pulsar star is real or fake. The dataset has an imbalanced target variable. We used model metrics (confusion matrix, recalling and precision) to examine the model accuracy under the original imbalanced dataset, the SMOTE and Near Miss resampling methods to reason why a model is inconclusive under an imbalanced dataset. 

If git cannot render the jupyter notebook, then please visit https://www.gitmemory.com/issue/iurisegtovich/PyTherm-applied-thermodynamics/11/495349877 for the following instruction to see my file:

Try to open that notebook that you want using nbviewer online, you don't need to install it.

Open "https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/"
Paste the link to your notebook, (e.g. "https://github.com/tanwaz/Predicting-a-Pulsar-Star/blob/master/Predict%20PULSAR.ipynb") 

This site nbviewer works independently of github.

If some notebook rendered in nbviewer appears different from rendered in github, then append "?flush_cache=true" to the end of the nbviewer version url to force it to rerender.
